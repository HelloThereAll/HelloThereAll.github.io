<h1>XENOÆNGLISH</h1>
<p>Hello & welocome to the official* page for onofficial english. This page is dedicated to the casue of destandardising english.</p>
<p>Standardised English is actually terrible. It is a standard built on 19th century english, via 17th century spellings approximating 11th century spelling conventions for norman fr*nch. Not even English! In additon, this orthographisation to match these archaic fr*nch conventions wasn't even consistent, either. For some languages, when their words were brought to english, a mere Romanisation, a type of system the 1:1 converts a language into the Roman alphabet, is used, which does not take into account the orthagraphic conventions of English, meaning what you will be left with is a mess of orthographies stapled together from the fr*nch abomination previous, in addition to whatever system of transliteration was used that week, and people just accept this.</p>
<p>It is thus that we are committed to the total destandardisation of the orthogrpaphy of english, as what is present now is simply unacceptable. For these ends, we have produced a megacompliation of alternatve english practices.</p>
