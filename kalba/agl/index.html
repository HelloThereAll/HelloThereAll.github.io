	<p>The world is changing like it never has before. The world is going to shift in its direction of power. The language for global speech may change to a language that has little in common with the current one. Change was going to happen; such is the nature of the world, but the one it is shifting to is very different in its make. But, it isn’t necessarily fair to the rising language to use a language that is just as different. What if there was a middle language for the world that would be less of a leap for everyone?</p>
	<p>Calvic, or Kalba as you will come to know it, is the language created in but a couple months, built on the knowledge of many years. Calvic is made to be this world language, the via-media of communication. It’s made to sound a lot like other languages, but sound like no-one of them in particular. This language, due to needing to communicate a number of ideas, will require some effort to learn. With that said, it's still a smaller language than most. With a few hundred words, it takes less time to learn than natural languages. So long as you can learn the structure, which is perhaps more than there needs to be, with only a couple months work, mastery is easily within your sights.</p>
	<p>As I had touched on before, This is meant to be a Language used between gorups of language speakers, meant to supercede English in this role. But why should it?</p>
	<p>Using a natural language such as English, French, or Chinese, gives a sense to whose who need to learn it talk to people in other parts of the world that this language, and thus the culture of those who speak it from birth, are the 'correct' culture or the 'correct' language. This is created, no matter the language in question. This is something that Calvic remedies, by virtue of being a language that is established nowhere in the world, with no pre-existing culture or people that it is tied to; A language that sounds like many but sounds like none of them on close inspection. Additionally, the sounds for which the language is made of are picked based on common crosslinguistic patterns.</p>
