	<p>The world is changing like it never has before. The world is going to shift in its direction of power. The language for global speech may change to a language that has little in common with the current one. Change was going to happen; such is the nature of the world, but the one it is shifting to is very different in its make. But, it isn’t necessarily fair to the rising language to use a language that is just as different. What if there was a middle language for the world that would be less of a leap for everyone?</p>
	<p>This is the motivation for the Invented Language I present to you: Calvic. Calvic, or Kalba, they mean the same thing, is the language created in a couple months, built on the knowledge of years. Calvic is made to be this world language, the via-media of communication. It’s made to sound a lot like other languages, but sound like no-one of them in particular. This language, due to needing to communicate a number of ideas, will require some effort to learn.</p>
	<p>With that said, it’s still a smaller language than most. With a few hundred words, it takes less time to learn than natural languages. So long as you can learn the grammar, with only a couple months work, mastery of only a few hundred words is easily within your sights.</p>
